type Lambda_FunctionTracingConfig struct {
	// Whether to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests with AWS X-Ray. Valid values are `PassThrough` and `Active`. If `PassThrough`, Lambda will only trace the request from an upstream service if it contains a tracing header with "sampled=1". If `Active`, Lambda will respect any tracing header it receives from an upstream service. If no tracing header is received, Lambda will call X-Ray for a tracing decision.
